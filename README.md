This repository will contain the device tree necessary to build an initial AOSP image for the SM-T510 (gta3xlwifi).

The commit messages in this repository will follow my process of building the device tree from scratch against AOSP comvention

This will serve as reference for understanding device configs within AOSP build system

## Development Notes

I have left my development on the backburner as of late, medical studies take precedence over free time. Wish it was not the case.

- Starting my device tree from scratch, and aiming to carry out what I intended.

### Changelog

- [gta3xlwifi-device](https://github.com/gta3xlwifi-dev/android_device_samsung_gta3xlwifi) - July 1, 2024: Refactoring, messy codebase. Decided to start over for my own sanity, will likely do so with the AOSP tree
