# AOSP Device Tree for the Galaxy Tab A 10.1 (gta3xlwifi)

This repository contains the device tree necessary to build initial AOSP-based images for the SM-T510 (gta3xlwifi).

The commit messages in this repository will follow my process of building the device tree from scratch for AOSP compatibility

This can serve as reference for understanding device configs within AOSP build system
